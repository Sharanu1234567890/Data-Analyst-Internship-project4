This dashboard was created in Power BI to give business stakeholders a clear and interactive view of key metrics like sales, profit, and growth. It includes KPI cards, time-series trends, and regional breakdowns. We've added filters and slicers so users can explore the data by year, region, category, and segment.

Some key takeaways include that the West region is leading in sales, Furniture is the most profitable category, and there's a noticeable sales spike in Q4, especially around November and December. The average delivery time is about 3.5 days.

Based on the insights, we suggest expanding into high-performing regions, improving delivery in slower areas, and optimizing discounts to boost profits."
